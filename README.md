# CavityHolography
A set of libraries to analyze spatial variations of coherent optical fields.
- HG.py contains a class to decompose a monochromatic image into paraxial Hermite-Gaussian modes.
- holograms.py contains a class to reconstruct the magnitude and phase of a laser field from an interferometric image.
